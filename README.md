# Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Muhammed Šehić, a first-year student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Sarajevo, specializing in Software Development. Here's a bit about me:

- 🔭 Currently exploring the realms of programming, video editing, Photoshop, and game development alongside my academic journey.
- 🌱 Always learning and refining skills to stay ahead in the tech world.
- 💬 Passionate about movies, American TV series, and nostalgic Yugoslav music.
- 📫 How to reach me: Visit my [contact page](sehic.rf.gd#contact) for more details or via the links provided below.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Around the time when I was born, [this single](https://youtu.be/4XvoXmcmVyQ) was popular, which is ironic because I was born in it.

### About Me

I'm driven by curiosity and a love for technology, with a knack for solving problems creatively. When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me indulging in movies, binge-watching series, or diving into the world of gaming or game design.
